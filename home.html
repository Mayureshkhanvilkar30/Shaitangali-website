  <p>Group Guidelines for Our Student Community

    Welcome to our student community! To maintain a respectful and enjoyable environment for everyone, please go through the following guidelines before joining:
    
    1. Respect Towards Everyone
    Light-hearted fun is welcome, but any form of disrespect towards girls will not be tolerated. We aim to keep the group safe and comfortable for all members.
    
    
    2. Banter Among Friends
    Boys can engage in casual banter and jokes, including the occasional rough language — as long as it stays friendly and doesn’t cross the line into serious conflict or physical threats. We're all friends here, and things should remain chill.
    
    
    3. Student-Only Discussions
    This is a student-only space. Please do not involve teachers or external parties in any internal group matters. If there's a concern or issue, kindly reach out to the group Admins instead of escalating it outside.
    
    
    4. Privacy & Discretion
    Group matters and discussions should stay within the group. Screenshots or sensitive information must not be shared externally, especially not with faculty or staff.
    
    
    5. Adding Classmates
    Feel free to add your fellow classmates using the link below:
